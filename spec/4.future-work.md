# Future Work

Mantra is a draft and there will be missing pieces and improvements we can do. We've currently identified the following features as important to Mantra and will be available in near future.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

It's extremely possible to do SSR with Mantra. We are trying to do this in a tool agnostic manner, but the reference implementation will be based on [FlowRouter SSR](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/tree/ssr).

## Distribute Mantra Modules via NPM

We could distribute Mantra modules via NPM. Once we do that, we could do reuse a lot of code between apps and organizations.

## Standard for Styling

It's better to have an standard to styling UI components.

## Standard for Tests

It's better to have an standard to write test cases.

## Reusing Composers

Sometimes, we can use re-use composer the same function in many places. We need to find a pattern for do that.
